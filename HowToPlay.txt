Welcome to the Name Memorization Game! This is a sort of flash card application that will help you
memorize a person's name and what he or she looks like by displaying an image on one side of a "card"
and his/her name on the other. You get points for every card you get correct and minus points for
every card you get incorrect. You can create your own deck of cards so that you can memorize your
preferred group of people. Use practice mode to help you memorize names so that you can do well in
the actual game.
