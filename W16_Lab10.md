Lab 10 for Domenic Dipeppe (drdipepperjr)

Issue 1: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-name-memorization/issues/8
Game should launch a menu with instructions and different options. Should probably have a 'Deck Editor' button and a 'Play Game' button

Issue 2: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-name-memorization/issues/23
The GUI looks AWFUL.
