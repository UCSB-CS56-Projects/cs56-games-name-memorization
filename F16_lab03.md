    (a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I’m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
    (b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
    (c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does,    
    (d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think
    	    is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make
    	   is more useful, fun, better, etc.
    (e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next
    	generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
    (f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old
    	    legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
    (g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this
    	    project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
    (h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
    (i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes
    	     of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and
    	     understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that
   	     programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
    (j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test
    	     coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to
   	     expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?


(a) The project is a flash card app that allows users to create flash cards and upload pictures to said cards.

(b) As a user I can create cards so that I can play the game. As a user I can create decks so that I can store the cards in and remove cards from. As a user I I can upload so that I can put a picture to the front side.

(c) In its current state the game can run. The game can create decks and save them with little issue. The game can upload pictures to the front of the card but not the back. 

(d) As a user I could change the font size so that the flash cards are more readable. As a user I could change the location of the picture so that the flash cards look better. As a user I could change the location of the text so that the flash cards look better.  

(e) The readme looks fine and is very informative. The readme could specify on the bugs the system has. There is little information on what bugs or issues the system currently suffers. The pictures need to be updated to reflect the current program.

(f) The current state of the build.xml file is great. All targets have descriptions. There seems to be no unnecessary JWS code.

(g) There are 1100 points available, just enough to pass the 1000 benchmark. Most of the issues are clearly defined but a few are too vague. With the limited amount of points, this could be a problem.

(h) We looked at the code and determined all issues with the code are already present in the repo.

(i) The code is organized into separate java files linked together by the main file. The GUI panels are separated from the deck objects into different classes. Each class has a clear purpose. The DeckList stores the Decks. The Decks hold Card objects. The deck of cards is abstracted into three separate components for easy organization. The CardEditor, NameGame, and DeckEditor are all GUIs meant for different purposes. The methods are clear and simple to understand. To help someone else understand the code I would tell them to look at the main file to see how all the classes interact.

(j) There are no JUnit tests.
