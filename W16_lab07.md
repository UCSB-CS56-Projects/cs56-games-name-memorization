Lab 07 for Domenic Dipeppe (drdipepperjr)

(a) Description:

A game in which the user can make their own flash-cards with a front and back side. The user can then give take a quiz of the deck of cards they made and give themselves points if they answered correctly.

(b) User Stories:

As a student, I can make my own set of flashcards so that I can study for my exams.
As someone who enjoys games, I can make a deck of cards so that I can play a memory game.
As a teacher, I can make a set of flashcards so that I can quiz my students about various topics.

(c) Software Assessment:

The program wors, for the most part. You can add cards to a deck, delete them, and edit them. They are displayed on the main screen "front" side up. There is an option to display the back side. You can also award yourself points or deduct them. When the program is loaded back up, it remembers the deck that was last created.

(d) Possible User Stories:

As a student, I want to make multiple decks so that I can study for more than one exam.
As a student, I want to be able to name my decks so that I can more easily find the deck that I want
As a gamer, I want to have a "play game" option so that I can enjoy using this software more.

(e) README.md Quality:

The README has all of the information needed, but it is a bit disorganized. For example, the instructions to run the game are appended to the end of a paragraph of text. It also does not say that some of the feature don't work, such as adding a new deck.

(f) build.xml Quality:

All targets have descriptions. None of the targets are out-of-date.

(g) Issues and Points:

There are a lot of issues that can be worked on, and there are definitely more that 1000 points worth of work to do. All of the issues are straightforward, although there are two issues that are the same that are awarded a different amount of points: "New deck" and "Implement multiple decks".

(h) Other Issues:

All of the current issues have already been covered.

(i) Code Assessment:

The code is fairly easy to read. There is quite a lack of documentation for methods and instance variables, although most of their purposes are obvious. 

The classes are fairly straightforward. Card is a JFrame that has two "sides" each with their own string of text, or a picture for the front. Deck is an ArrayList of Card objects. NameGame creates most of the functionality of the program; It allows adding, editing, and deletion of cards in a deck. CardEditor allows us to edit a pre-existing card in a deck. Main starts the program and initializes only one Deck. On open, it loads the previous deck. On close, it writes the current deck to a file called "Deck.ser".

For someone starting out with this code, it would probably be easiest to just play the game to see the full functionality because the most important class, "NameGame", is very long (because it has to be). If you can't play the game, then look at the README, especially the screenshots.

(j) Test Coverage:

There are no tests. If I were to make test cases, I would probably make a few decks filled with cards that have different test cases (i.e. no text inputted, picture on front, empty deck, too much text, etc...). I would also test multiple decks if it was a feature.
