===============================


1. This is a flashcard application to help you memorize things. It keeps score
   and keeps track of how many crads are in the deck and which one you are on.

2. As the user I can start the application, add/delete/edit flashcards and add
   images, cycle through all of the cards, specify if you got them right or wrong (keep score
   of your studying), add multiple decks for different topics, and reset the
   score.

3. The software compiles and runs fine with our inital tests. It is sucessfuly
   able to do all functions in part 2.

4. Automatic checking if you answered correctly, be able to add more kinds of files to side of flash card, add hints, and load information about front side from wikipedia.

5. The readme does a very poor job of explaining what the program is and what it
   does. We didn't really understand it until we launched the application and
   played around with it. It needs a better explanation of the purpose of the
   application.

6. The build.xml is not missing any target descriptions. Every looks clean and
   streamlined.

7. There are enough issues in this project to earn 1000 point. The issues are
   very clear on expecatations. More issues should be found to allow for more
   choice.

8. Compiling the javadoc has a couple of errors. https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-name-memorization/issues/32

9. The code is well documented with javadocs and the functions are relatively
   small making it easy to understand. The constructor in NameGame.java does a
   lot of stuff to set up the GUI and isnt documented super well and is kind of
   confusing to follow. Most of the classes have alot of annotations that help
   to understand what each line of code is doing without having a great
   understanding of the rest of the code.

10. There are no JUnit tests written right now (one of the issues is to create
    JUnit tests). Most of the classes need JUnit tests written for them because
    any changes of code could break some of the fundamental classes. It would be
    good to add tests to all of the basic classes first.
